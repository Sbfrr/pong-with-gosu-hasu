# Pong Game

Play a game which will never really get out of fashion !

## Goal

This project is a game to make a first project with both Gosu and Hasu gems.
It was largely inspired by a talk at [Madison Ruby 2013](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2636-madisonruby2013-rapid-game-prototyping-with-ruby).

## Motivation

I wanted to build a basic Game to learn the basic mechanisms of it and understand its patterns. My goal is to build on this experienceto make a ruby add-on for Gosu to enable people to easily play games from different machines.

You can follow the evolution of the add-on here:
[Multiplayer library for Gosu](https://github.com/Sbfrr/multiplayer-library-for-gosu).

## Requirements

So what do you need to run this game ?

* ruby
* [gem Gosu](http://www.libgosu.org/)
* [gem Hasu](https://github.com/michaelfairley/hasu)
